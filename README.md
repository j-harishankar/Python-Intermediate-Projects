## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/j-harishankar/Python-Intermediate-Projects.git
   cd Python-Intermediate-Projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd "project-folder-name"
   ```

3. **Run the Python script(s):**
   Most projects can be started using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   (Replace `main.py` with the appropriate filename if different.)

**Note:**  
Some projects may require additional Python libraries. Refer to the code comments or a `requirements.txt` file (if provided) within the project folder.
